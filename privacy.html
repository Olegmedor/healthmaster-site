  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 14 December 2025</p>

  <p>
    HealthMaster respects user privacy and is committed to protecting personal data.
    This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and what rights users have.
  </p>

  <p><strong>HealthMaster is operated by LLC IDEA.</strong></p>

  <h2>1. Scope of this Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to all HealthMaster services, including the HealthMaster website,
    Telegram bot and messaging interfaces, and integrations with third-party platforms and devices (such as Garmin).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 Data provided directly by users</h3>
  <p>We may collect data voluntarily provided by users, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>food descriptions and meal entries</li>
    <li>subjective inputs such as mood or self-reported sleep quality</li>
    <li>messages sent via the Telegram bot or contact forms</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Data from connected devices and platforms</h3>
  <p>
    If a user explicitly connects a third-party account (for example, Garmin), HealthMaster may receive fitness and wellness data,
    such as activity data (steps, workouts, energy expenditure), sleep data, and related wellness metrics made available by the connected platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    We only receive data that the user explicitly authorizes during the connection process.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Purpose of Data Processing</h2>
  <p>We process personal data solely for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>providing personal wellness insights and summaries</li>
    <li>calculating and displaying consumed and expended energy</li>
    <li>analyzing trends related to activity, sleep, and nutrition</li>
    <li>improving the quality and reliability of HealthMaster services</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> use personal data for advertising, profiling for marketing purposes, or resale.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
  <p>
    Personal data is processed based on the user’s explicit consent and the user’s voluntary interaction with HealthMaster services.
    Users may withdraw consent at any time by disconnecting integrations or requesting data deletion.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    HealthMaster does <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties.
    Data received from connected platforms (such as Garmin) is used exclusively within HealthMaster and strictly in accordance with
    the permissions granted by the user and applicable platform policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to provide the service.
    Users may request access to their data or deletion of their data. Upon request, all associated personal data will be permanently deleted within a reasonable timeframe.
  </p>

  <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on applicable laws, users have the right to access their personal data, request correction or deletion,
    withdraw consent, and disconnect third-party integrations at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    HealthMaster services are not intended for children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available on this page.
  </p>
